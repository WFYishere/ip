# AI-Assisted Development Log

This project uses AI tools to increase productivity while meeting iP requirements.

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI): prompt-driven code assistance and review suggestions.

## Usage Records

### 2025-09-20 â€” C-Sort (Category C Extension)
- **What AI did:** Suggested a minimal insertion for a `sort` command inside the existing command switch in `src/main/java/quokka/Quokka.java`, keeping the codebase structure unchanged (no new classes).
- **Why helpful:** Reduced implementation time and ensured zero behavior drift elsewhere.
- **Developer review:** Verified that the change compiles and that the command behaves as intended (alphabetical, case-insensitive).

## Notes
- AI suggestions are treated as drafts; final decisions and verifications are done by the developer.
- This file will be updated if/when more AI-assisted changes are adopted.
